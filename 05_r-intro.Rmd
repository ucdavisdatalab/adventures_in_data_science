## Before We Start

**What is R and RStudio?** ["R"](https://www.r-project.org/about.html) is both a free and open source programming language designed for statistical computing and graphics, and the software for interpreting the code written in the R language. [RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) is an integrative development environment (IDE) within which you can write and execute code, and interact with the R software. It's an interface for working with the R software that allows you to see your code, plots, variables, etc. all on one screen. This functionality can help you work with R, connect it with other tools, and manage your workspace and projects. You don't need RStudio to use R, but many people find that using RStudio makes writing, editing, searching and running their code easier. You cannot run RStudio without having R installed. While RStudio is a commercial product, the free version is sufficient for most researchers.

You can download R for free [here](https://cloud.r-project.org/).
You can download RStudio Desktop Open-Source Edition for free [here](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).

**Why learn R?** There are many advantages to working with R. 

* **Scientific integrity.** Working with a scripting language like R facilitates reproducible research. Having the commands for an analysis captured in code promotes transparency and reproducibility. Someone using your code and data should be able to exactly reproduce your analyses. An increasing number of research journals not only encourage, but are beginning to require, submission of code along with a manuscript. 
* **Many data types and sizes.** R was designed for statistical computing and thus incorporates many data structures and types to facilitate analyses. It can also connect to local and cloud databases.
* **Graphics.** R has buit-in plotting functionalities that allow you to adjust any aspect of your graph to effectively tell the story of your data.
* **Open and cross-platform.** Because R is free, open-source software that works across many different operating systems, anyone can inspect the source code, and report and fix bugs. It is supported by a large community of users and developers.
* **Interdisciplinary and extensible.** Because anyone can write and share R packages, it provides a framework for integrating approaches across domains, encouraging innovation.   

**Navigating the interface**

The first time you open RStudio, you'll see a window divided into several
panes, like this:

<img src="img/rstudio_start.png">

The exact presentation of the panes might be slightly different depending on your operating system, versions of R and RStudio, and any set preferences. Generally, the panes include:

* **Source** is your script. You can write your code here and save this as a .R file and re-run to reproduce your results. 
* **Console** is where you run the code. You can type directly here, but anything entered here won't be saved when you exit RStudio.
* **Environment/history** lists all the objects you have created (including your data) and the commands you have run. 
* **Files/plots/packages/help/viewer** pane is useful for locating files on your machine to read into R, inspecting any graphics you create, seeing a list of available packages, and getting help.
   
To interact with R, compose your code in the source pane and use the execute (or run) command to send them to the console. ([Shortcuts](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/rstudio-ide.pdf): You can use the shortcut Ctrl + Enter, or Cmd + Return, to run a line of code.)

*_Create a script file for today's lecture and save it to your lecture_3 folder under ist008_2022 in your home directory. (It's good practice to keep your projects organized., Some suggested sub-folders for a research project might be: data, documents, scripts, and, depending on your needs, other relevant outputs or products such as figures._*

## Mathematical Operations

R works by the process of "REPL": Read-Evaluate-Print-Loop:

1. R waits for you to type an expression (a single piece of code) and press `Enter`.
2. R then **reads** in your expressions and parses them. It reads whether the expression is syntactically correct. If so, it will then
3. **evaluate** the code to compute a result.
4. R then **prints** the result in the console and
5. **loops** back around to wait for your next expression.

You can use R like a calculator to see how it processes expressions. 

```{r echo=T, results='hide'}
7 + 2
```
R always puts the result on a separate line (or lines) from your code. In this case, the result begins with the tag `[1]`, which is a hint from R that the
result is a *vector* and that this line starts with the *element* at position 1. We'll learn more about vectors later in this lesson, and eventually learn
about other data types that are displayed differently.

If you enter an incomplete expression, R will get stuck at the evaluate step and change the prompt to `+`, then wait for you to type the rest of the expression and press the `Enter` key. If this happens, you can finish entering the expression on the new line, or you can cancel it by pressing the `Esc` key (or `Ctrl-c` if you're using R without RStudio). R can only tell an expression is incomplete if it's missing something that it is expecting, like the second operand here: 

```{r echo=T, results='hide', error=TRUE}
7 -
```

Let's do more math! Other arithmetic operators are:

* `-` for subtraction
* `*` for multiplication
* `/` for division
* `%%` for remainder division (modulo)
* `^` or `**` for exponentiation


```{r echo=T, results='hide'}
7 - 2
244/12
2 * 12
```

Arithmetic in R follows an **order of operations** (aka _PEMDAS_): parenthesis, exponents, multiplication and division, addition and subtraction. You can combine these and use parentheses to make more complicated expressions, just as you would when writing a mathematical expression. 

For example, to estimate the area of a circle with radius 3, you can write:

```{r}
3.14 * 3^2
```

To see the complete order of operations, use the help command:

```{r, echo=T, eval=F}
?Syntax
```

You can also perform other operations in R:

```{r, echo=T, eval=F}
3 > 1
3 < 1
```

*Tip: You can write R expressions with any number of spaces (including none) around the operators and R will still compute the result. Nevertheless, putting spaces in your code makes it easier for you and others to read, so it's good to make it a habit. Put spaces around most operators, after commas, and after keywords.*


## Variables

Since R is designed for mathematics and statistics, you might expect that it provides a better appoximation for $\pi$ than `3.14`. R and most other programming languages allow you to create and store values called **variables**. Variables allow you to reuse the result of a computation, write general expressions (such as `a*x + b`), and break up your code into smaller steps so it's easier to test and understand. 

R has a built in variable called 'pi' for the value of $\pi$. You can display a variable's value by entering its name in the console:

```{r echo=T, results='hide'}
pi
```

You can also use variables in mathematical expressions. Here's a more precise calculation of the area of a circle with radius 3:

```{r echo=T, results='hide'}
pi *3^2
```

You can define your own variables with the assignment operator '=' or '<-'. Variable names can contain letters, numbers, dots `.`, and underscores `_`, but they *cannot* begin with a number. Spaces and other symbols are not allowed in variable names. In general, variable names should be descriptive but concise, and should not use the same name as common (base R) functions like mean, T, median, sum, etc..

Let's make some more variables:

```{r echo=T, results='hide'}
x <- 10
y <- 24
fantastic.variable2 = x
x <- y / 2
```

In R, variables are **copy-on-write**.  When we change a variable (a "write"), R automatically copies the original value so dependent variables are unchanged until they are re-run.

```{r echo=T, results='hide'}
x <- 13
y <- x
x <- 16
y
```

Why do you think copy-on-write is helpful? Where do you think it could trip you up?


## Calling Functions

R has many **functions** (reusable commands) built-in that allow you to compute mathematical operations, statistics, and perform other computing tasks on your variables. You can think of a function as a machine that takes some inputs and uses them to produce some output. Code that uses a function is said to *call* that function. When you call a function, the values that you assign as input are called **arguments**. The output is called the **return value**. 

We call a function by writing its name followed by a parentheses containing the arguments.

```{r echo=T, results='hide'}
log(10)
sqrt(9)
```

Many functions have multiple parameters and can accept multiple arguments. For example, the `sum` function accepts any number of arguments and adds them all together. When you call a function with multiple arguments, separate the arguments with commas.

```{r echo=T, results='hide'}
sum(5, 4, 1)
```
When you call a function, R assigns each argument to a **parameter**. Parameters are special variables that represent the inputs to a function and only exist
while that function runs. For example, the `log` function, which computes a logarithm, has parameters `x` and `base` for the operand and base of the
logaritm, respectively. 

By default, R assigns arguments to parameters based on their order. The first argument is assigned to the function's first parameter, the second to the second, and so on. If you know the order that a function expects to receive the parameters then you can list them separated by commas. Here the argument 64 is assigned to the parameter `x`, and the argument 2 is assigned to the parameter `base`. 

```{r echo=T, results='hide'}
log(64, 2)
```

You can also assign arguments to parameters by name with `=` (but not with `<-`), overriding their positions. 

```{r echo=T, results='hide'}
log(64, base = 2)
log(base = 2, x= 64)
```

*Tip: Both of these expressions are equivalent, so which one should you use? When you write code, choose whatever seems the clearest to you. Leaving parameter names out of calls saves typing, but including some or all of them can make the code easier to understand.*


Not sure what parameters a specific function needs? Read on for how to get...

## HELP! 

This is just the beginning, and there are lots of resources to help you learn more. R has built-in help files that can be accessed with the **`?`** and **`help`** commands. You can also search within the help documentation using the **`??`** commands. There's also a vibrant online help community. Here are some examples of how you can use all this help to help yourself:

**?** The help pages for all of R's built-in functions usually have the same name as the function itself. Function help pages usually include a brief description, a list of parameters, a description of the return value, and some examples. To open the help page for the `log` function:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
?log
```

There are also help pages for other topics, such as built-in mathematical constants (such as `?pi`), data sets (such as `?cars`), and operators. To look up the help page for an operator, put the operator's name in single or double quotes. For example, this code opens the help page for the arithmetic operators:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
?"+"
```

*Tip: It's always okay to put single or double quotes around the name of the page when you use `?`, but they're only required if it contains arthmetic commands or non-alphabetic characters. So `?sqrt`, `?'sqrt'`, and `?"sqrt"` all open the documentation for `sqrt`, the square root function. Why does this work?  R treats anything inside single or double quotes as literal text rather than as an expression to evaluate. In programming jargon, a piece of literal text is called a _string_. You can use whichever kind of quotes you prefer, but the quote at the beginning of the string must match the quote at the end. We'll learn more about strings in later lessons when we cover working with unstructured data.*

**??** Sometimes you might not know the name of the help page you want to look up. You can do a general search of R's help pages with `??` followed by a string of search terms. For example, to get a list of all help pages related to linear models:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
??"linear model"
```

This search function doesn't always work well, and it's often more efficient to use an online search engine. When you search for help with R online, include
"R" as a search term. Alternatively, you can use [RSeek][rseek], which restricts the search to a selection of R-related websites.

[rseek]: https://rseek.org/

In later lessons we'll learn about packages, which are sharable bundles of code. You'll often need to look up the documentation to get help figuring out how to work with a new package. You can view a package's help documentation using `packageDescription("Name")`. 


### When Something Goes Wrong (and it will)

Sooner or later you'll run some code and get an error message or result you didn't expect. Don't panic! Even experienced programmers make mistakes regularly, so learning how to diagnose and fix problems is vital. We call this troubleshooting or debugging. 

Stay calm and try going through these steps:

1. If R returned a warning or error message, read it! If you're not sure what the message means, try searching for it online.
2. Check your code for typ0s. Did you capitalize something that should be lower case? Are you missing or have an extra comma, quote, parenthesis?
3. Test your code one line at a time, starting from the beginning. After each line that assigns a variable, check that the value of the variable is what you expect. Try to determine the exact line where the problem originates (which may differ from the line that emits an error!). Sometimes the "shut it down and restart" trick really works - you might have created a variable and forgot about it, and you need a fresh start for the code to work as intended. 

**If all else fails, just Google it.** [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r) is a popular question and answer website and you can often find solutions to your problems there, or pick up tips to help you tackle your problem in a new way. On CRAN, check out the [Intro to R Manual](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-intro.pdf) and [R FAQ](http://cran.r-project.org/doc/FAQ/R-FAQ.html). Many regions also have grassroots R-Users Groups that you can join and ask for help. Just remember to pay it forward and use your newfound R prowess to help others in the community on their learning journies!

*Tip: When asking for help, clearly state the problem and provide a [reproducible example](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Reproducibility.html). [R also has a posting guide](http://www.r-project.org/posting-guide.html) to help you write questions that are more likely to get a helpful reply. It's also a good idea to save your `sessionInfo()` so you can show others how your machine and session was configured. Doing this before coming to office hours for a programming class is also highly recommended!*



## Vectors

A **vector** is an ordered collection of values. The values in a vector are
called **elements**. Vectors can have any number of elements, including 0 or 1
element. For example, a single value, like `3`, is a vector with 1 element. So
every value that you've worked with in R so far was a vector.

The elements of a vector must all be the same type of data (we say the elements
are **homogeneous**). A vector can contain integers, decimal numbers, strings (text),
or several other types of data, but not a mix these all at once.

You can combine or concatenate vectors to create a longer vector with the `c`
function:

```{r echo=T, results='hide'}
# numbers
time.min <- c(5, 4, 4, 12, 10, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 19)

# strings
pets <- c("woof", "woof", "cat", "woof", "woof", "cat", "woof", "woof", "woof",
  "woof", "woof")
place <- c("Temple", "Yakitori", "Panera", "Yakitori", "Guads", "Home",
  "Tea List", "Raising Canes", "Pachamama", "Lazi Cow", "Wok of Flame")

```

You can check the length of a vector (and other objects) with the `length`
function:

```{r}
length(3)
length("hello")
length(time.min)
length(logi)
```


### Indexing Vectors

Vectors are ordered, which just means the elements have specific positions. For
example, in the `place` vector, the value of the 1st element is `"Temple"`, the
2nd is `"Yakitori"`, the 5th is `"Guads"`, and so on.

You can access individual elements of a vector with the _indexing operator_ `[`
(also called the _square bracket operator_). The way to write it, or **syntax**
is:

```
VECTOR[INDEXES]
```

Here `INDEXES` is a vector of positions of elements you want to get or set.

For example, let's get the 2nd element of the `place` vector:

```{r}
place[2]
```

Now let's get the 3rd and 1st element:

```{r}
place[c(3, 1)]
```

Indexing is among the most frequently used operations in R, so take some time
to try it out with few different vectors and indexes. We'll revisit indexing in
a later lesson to learn a lot more about it.


### Vectorization

Let's look at what happens if we call a mathematical function, like `sqrt`, on
a vector:

```{r}
x <- c(2, 16, 4, 7)
sqrt(x)
```

This gives us the same result as if we had called the function separately on
each element. That is, the result is the same as:

```{r}
c(sqrt(2), sqrt(16), sqrt(4), sqrt(7))
```

Of course, the first version is much easier to type.

Functions that take a vector argument and get applied element-by-element are
called  **vectorized** functions. Most functions in R are vectorized,
especially math functions. Some examples include `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `log`,
`exp`, and `sqrt`.

A function can be vectorized across multiple arguments. This is easiest to
understand in terms of the arithmetic operators. Let's see what happens if we
add two vectors together:

```{r}
x = c(1, 2, 3, 4)
y = c(-1, 7, 10, -10)
x + y
```

The elements are paired up and added according to their positions. The other
arithmetic operators are also vectorized:

```{r}
x - y
x * y
x / y
```

Functions that are not vectorized tend to be ones that combine or aggregate
values in some way. For instance, the `sum`, `length`, and `class` functions
are not vectorized.


## Data Frames

We frequently work with 2-dimensional tables of data (also called **tabular**
data). Typically each row corresponds to a single subject and is called an
**observation**. Each column corresponds to a measurement of the subject.

In data science, the columns of a table are called **features** or
**covariates**. Sometimes people also refer to them as "variables", but that
can be confusing as "variable" means something else in R, so here we'll try to
avoid that term.

R's structure for tabular data is the **data frame.** The columns are vectors,
so the elements within a column must all be the same type of data. In a data
frame, every column must have the same number of elements (so the table is
rectangular). There are no restrictions on the data types in each row.

You can use the `data.frame` function to create a data frame from column
vectors:

```{r echo=T, results='hide'}
# current data (vectors)
time.min
place
pets

# create new data (vectors)
distance.mi <- c(0.9, 0.6, 0.8, 0.6, 2, 100, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 1, 3.7)

major <- c("chicanix studies", "human development", "economics", "undeclared",
  "psychology", "MMM", "psychology", "undeclared", "human development",
  "undeclared", "GG")

# combine vectors into dataframe
my.data <- data.frame(place, distance.mi, time.min, major, pets)
```


### Selecting Columns

You can select an individual column from a data frame by name with `$`, the
dollar sign operator. The syntax is:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
VARIABLE$COLUMN_NAME
```
 
For instance, to select the `place` column:

```{r}
my.data$place
```

The selected column is just a vector, so you can assign it to a variable and
use it in functions. For example, to compute the sum of the `distance.mi`
column:

```{r}
sum(my.data$distance.mi)
```


### Inspecting Data

You can print a small dataset, but it can be slow and hard to read especially if there are a lot of coumns. R has many built in functions to inspect objects:

```{r echo=T, results='hide'}
head(my.data) # this prints only the beginning of the dataset
tail(my.data) # this prints only the end of the dataset
nrow(my.data) # number of rows
ncol(my.data) # number of columns
ls(my.data) # 
rownames(my.data) # names of the rows
```

A highly informative function for inspecting the structure of a data frame or
other object is `str`:

```{r echo=T, results='hide'}
str(my.data)  
```

Tidy"][tidy] that covers best practices for structuring, naming, and organizing
your data frames (and spreadsheets).*

Data Types & Classes
--------------------

Data can be categorized into different _types_ based on sets of shared
characteristics. For instance, statisticians tend to think about whether data
are numeric or categorical:

* numeric
    + continuous (real or complex numbers)
    + discrete (integers)
* categorical
    + nominal (categories with no ordering)
    + ordinal (categories with some ordering)

Of course, other types of data, like graphs (networks) and natural language
(books, speech, and so on), are also possible. Categorizing data this way is
useful for reasoning about which methods to apply to which data.

In R, data objects are categorized in two different ways:

1. The **class** of an R object describes what the object does, or the role
   that it plays. Sometimes objects can do more than one thing, so objects can
   have more than one class. The `class` function returns the classes of its
   argument.

2. The **type** of an R object describes what the object is. Technically, the
   type corresponds to how the object is stored in your computer's memory. Each
   object has exactly one type. The `typeof` function returns the type of its
   argument.

Of the two, classes tend to be more important than types. If you aren't sure
what an object is, checking its classes should be the first thing you do.

The built-in classes you'll use all the time correspond to vectors and lists
(which we'll learn more about in Section \@ref(lists)):

| Class     | Example               | Description
| :----     | :------               | :----------
| logical   | `TRUE`, `FALSE`       | Logical (or Boolean) values
| integer   | `-1L`, `1L`, `2L`     | Integer numbers
| numeric   | `-2.1`, `7`, `34.2`   | Real numbers
| complex   | `3-2i`, `-8+0i`       | Complex numbers
| character | `"hi"`, `"YAY"`       | Text strings
| list      | `list(TRUE, 1, "hi")` | Ordered collection of heterogeneous elements


The class of a vector is the same as the class of its elements:

```{r}
class("hi")
class(c("hello", "hi"))
```

In addition, for ordinary vectors, the class and the type are the same:

```{r}
x <- c(TRUE, FALSE)
class(x)
typeof(x)
```

The exception to this rule is numeric vectors, which have type `double` for
historical reasons:

```{r}
class(pi)
typeof(pi)
typeof(3)
```

The word "double" here stands for [_double-precision floating point
number_][double], a standard way to represent real numbers on computers.

[double]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format

By default, R assumes any numbers you enter in code are numeric, even if
they're integer-valued.

The class `integer` also represents integer numbers, but it's not used as often
as `numeric`. A few functions, such as the sequence operator `:` and the
`length` function, return integers. The difference between `numeric` and
`integer` is generally not important.

```{r}
class(3)
class(length(logi))
class(1:3)
```

Besides the classes for vectors and lists, there are several built-in classes
that represent more sophisticated data structures:

| Class      | Description
| :----      | :----------
| function   | Functions
| factor     | Categorical values
| matrix     | Two-dimensional ordered collection of homogeneous elements
| array      | Multi-dimensional ordered collection of homogeneous elements
| data.frame | Data frames

For these, the class is usually different from the type. We'll learn more about
most of these later on.


### Lists

A **list** is an ordered data structure where the elements can have different
types (they are **heterogeneous**). This differs from a vector, where the
elements all have to have the same type, as we saw in Section \@ref(vectors).
The tradeoff is that most vectorized functions do not work with lists.

You can make an ordinary list with the `list` function:

```{r}
x <- list(1, c("hi", "bye"))
class(x)
typeof(x)
```

For ordinary lists, the type and the class are both `list`. In a later lesson,
we'll learn how to get and set list elements, and more about when and why to
use lists.

You've already seen one list, the `my.data` data frame:

```{r}
class(my.data)
typeof(my.data)
```

Under the hood, data frames are lists, and each column is a list element.
Because the class is `data.frame` rather than `list`, R treats data frames
differently from ordinary lists. For example, R prints data frames differently
from ordinary lists.


### Implicit Coercion

R's types fall into a natural hierarchy of expressiveness:

<img src="img/implicit_coercion.png">

Each type on the right is more expressive than the ones to its left.

For example, with the convention that `FALSE` is `0` and `TRUE` is `1`, we can
represent any logical value as an integer. In turn, we can represent any
integer as a double, and any double as a complex number. By writing the number
out, we can also represent any complex number as a string.

The point is that no information is lost as we follow the arrows from left to
right along the types in the hierarchy. In fact, R will automatically and
silently convert from types on the left to types on the right as needed. This
is called **implicit coercion**.

As an example, consider what happens if we add a logical value to a number:

```{r}
TRUE + 2
```

R automatically converts the `TRUE` to the numeric value `1`, and then carries
out the arithmetic as usual.

We've already seen implicit coercion at work once before, when we learned the
`c` function. Since the elements of a vector all have to have the same type, if
you pass several different types to `c`, then R tries to use implicit coercion
to make them the same:

```{r}
x <- c(TRUE, "hi", 1, 1+3i)
class(x)
x
```

Implicit coercion is strictly one-way; it never occurs in the other direction.
If you want to coerce a type on the right to one on the left, you can do it
explicitly with one of the `as.TYPE` functions. For instance, the `as.numeric`
(or `as.double`) function coerces to numeric:

```{r}
as.numeric("3.1")
```

There are a few types that fall outside of the hierarchy entirely, like
functions. Implicit coercion doesn't apply to these. If you try to use these
types where it doesn't make sense to, R generally returns an error:

```{r, error = TRUE}
sin + 3
```

If you try to use these types as elements of a vector, you get back a list
instead:

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, sum)
class(x)
```

Understanding how implicit coercion works will help you avoid bugs, and can
also be a time-saver.



### Factors

A feature is **categorical** if it measures a qualitative category. For
example, the genres `rock`, `blues`, `alternative`, `folk`, `pop` are
categories.

R uses the class `factor` to represent categorical data. Visualizations and
statistical models sometimes treat factors differently than other data types,
so it's important to make sure you have the right data type. If you're ever
unsure, remember that you can check the class of an object with the `class`
function.

When you load a data set, R usually can't tell which features are categorical.
That means identifying and converting the categorical features is up to you.
For beginners, it can be difficult to understand whether a feature is
categorical or not. The key is to think about whether you want to use the
feature to divide the data into groups.

For example, if we want to know how many songs are in the `rock` genre, we
first need to divide the songs by genre, and then count the number of songs in
each group (or at least the `rock` group).

As a second example, months recorded as numbers can be categorical or not,
depending on how you want to use them. You might want to treat them as
categorical (for example, to compute max rainfall in each month) or you might
want to treat them as numbers (for example, to compute the number of months
time between two events).

The bottom line is that you have to think about what you'll be doing in the
analysis. In some cases, you might treat a feature as categorical only for part
of the analysis.

Let's think about which features are categorical in `my.data` data set. To
refresh our memory of what's in the data set, we can look at the structural
summary:

```{r}
str(my.data)
```

Let's convert the `place` column to a factor. To do this, use the `factor`
function:
```{r}
place = factor(my.data$place)
head(place)
```

Notice that factors are printed differently than strings.

The categories of a factor are called **levels**. You can list the levels with
the `levels` function:
```{r}
levels(place)
```

Factors remember all possible levels even if you take a subset:
```{r}
place[c(1, 2, 3)]
```

This is the main way factors differ from strings. Factors "remember" all
possible levels even if they aren't present. This ensures that if you plot a
factor, the missing levels will still be represented on the plot.


<!--
You can make a factor forget levels that aren't present with the `droplevels`
function:
```{r}
#droplevels(age[1:3])
```

## Subsetting

Sometimes you will want to work with only specific elements in a vector or data frame. To do that, you can refer to the position of the element, which is also also called the index.

```{r echo=T, results='hide'}
#length(time.min)
#time.min[15]
```

You can also subset by using the name of an element in a list. The `$` operator
extracts a named element from a list, and is useful for extracting the columns
from data frames.

How can we use subsetting to look only at the distance response?
 
```{r echo=T, results='hide'}
#my.data$distance.mi
#my.data[,2]
#distances2<-my.data[["distance.mi"]]
#distances3<-my.data[[2]]
```

What are the responses for psychology majors?

```{r echo=T, eval=F}
#psyc_major <- my.data[which(my.data$major == 'psychology'), ]
#View(polisci_majors)
#
#which(my.data$major == "psychology")
#shortframe<-my.data[c(4,8,13),]
```

What are the majors of the first 5 students who replied?

```{r echo=T, results='hide'}
#shortframe2 <- my.data[1:5,"major"]             # range for rows, columns
```

You can also use `$`  to create an element within the data frame.

```{r echo=T, results='hide'}
#my.data$mpm <- my.data$distance.mi / my.data$time.min
```
