## What is Version Control?

**Version control** is the process of storing and organizing multiple versions
(or copies) of files on your computer. Approaches to version control range from
simple to complex and they can involve the use of both manual and automatic
workflows.

Chances are good that you're already doing some kind of version control
yourself. You might have a directory somewhere on your computer that looks
something like this:

![](/images/version-control/mac_finder_1.png)

Or perhaps this:

![](/images/version-control/mac_window_2.png)

This is a rudimentary form of version control where it's completely up to you
to name, save, and keep track of multiple versions of a file. This **filesystem
approach** works minimally well, in that it does provide you with a history of
file versions theoretically organized by their time sequence. But this system
provides no information about how the file has changed from version to version,
why you might have saved a particular version, or specifically how the various
versions are related. This approach is also subject to human error. It's easy
to make a mistake when naming a file version, or to go back and edit a file
without saving a new copy.

## Version Control Systems

A **version control system** (VCS) is software designed to automate version
control. Version control systems originated in the software development
community, where it's common for many people to work on the same file,
sometimes synchronously, amplifying the need to track and understand revisions.
But nearly all types of computer files, not just code, can be tracked using
modern version control systems.

:::{admonition} Historical Note
:class: note
IBM’s OS/360 IEBUPDTE software update tool is widely regarded as the earliest
and most widely adopted precursor to modern version control systems. Its
release in 1972 of the Source Code Control System (SCCS) package marked the
first fully-fledged system designed specifically for software version control.
:::

Most version control systems keep track of changes to a collection of files
called a **repository**. Generally, a repository (or repo) is just a directory
where you've set up a version control system to keep track of changes to the
contents. A repository can contain any number of files and subdirectories.

:::{tip}
How many repositories to create is up to you, and depends on how you like to
work, but we recommend that you create a separate repository for each distinct
project.
:::

In order to make it easy to collaborate, most version control systems also
provide a way to create multiple copies of a repository and share changes
between them. Version control systems can be divided into two categories based
on how they do this:

1. **Centralized** version control systems store the repository and its history
   on a single computer. This computer is usually a **server**, a computer
   connected to the Internet or some other network. Users can check out a copy
   of the repository from the server, make changes, and then check in their
   changes with the server. The server is the sole authority on the
   repository's history. You can think of this as a "hub and spoke" model,
   where the server is the hub and users are the spokes. This is the oldest
   kind of version control system.

2. **Distributed** version control systems treat each copy of the repository as
   an authority on the repository's history, and provide ways to sync changes
   and resolve conflicts between copies. As two different users make changes to
   their copies of the repository, the copies will diverge if both users edit
   the same file. The divergence will remain in place until the two copies are
   synced, at which time the VCS merges the two different versions of the file
   into a single version that reflects the changes made by both users. You can
   think of this as a "network" model (like a social network).

Centralized VCS provide a very ordered and controlled universe. They ensure
users have access to the most recent version of every file in the repository,
which reduces the potential for conflicting changes to files.

:::{admonition} Historical Note
:class: note
Early centralized version control systems typically required users to check out
individual files or directories rather than entire repositories, and only
allowed one user to check out a given file at time. This prevented conflicting
edits, but made it difficult to work concurrently.
:::

On the other hand, distributed VCS offer greater flexibility. They allow users
to work alone or in small groups, work offline, or work on experimental changes
over an extended period without losing the benefits of version control. These
characteristics facilitate collaborative work. Moreover, a distributed VCS can
be used in a centralized way, where one copy of the repository is treated as
the final authority on the repository's history. This gives users the best of
both worlds, by allowing some to sync directly with each other while others
sync with this authoritative copy.

The most popular VCS today is [Git][], a distributed VCS. Some polls estimate
that more than 90% of all developers use Git. A few other version control
systems in use today include Mercurial, Subversion, Perforce, and Plastic SCM.
Many document editors, such as Google Docs and Microsoft Word, also have
built-in version control systems. Each of these systems offers a twist on
version control, differing sometimes in the area of user functionality,
sometimes in how they handle things on the back-end, and sometimes both. In
this reader, we'll focus on Git.

:::::{important}
Git is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Install Git by following the instructions for your computer's operating system:

::::{tab-set}

:::{tab-item} Windows
On Windows, download Git from [the Git downloads page][install-git]. We
recommend the default installation options, which also install Git Bash. You'll
need Git Bash to follow along with this workshop.
:::

:::{tab-item} macOS
<!-- FIXME: do we want them to install with Pixi instead? Xcode is ~30GB -->
On macOS, there are many ways to install Git. The easiest is generally to
install Xcode by opening a terminal and entering:

```none
git --version
```

Then follow the prompts to install Xcode. If you prefer not to install Xcode
(it is quite large), installing Git with a package manager such as Homebrew,
MacPorts, or [Pixi][dl-pixi] is also okay.
:::

:::{tab-item} Linux
On Linux, we recommend installing Git with your distribution's package manager
(many distributions install Git by default). Installing Git with a user-level
package manager such as [Pixi][dl-pixi] is also okay.

You can also find more information about how to install Git in the section
[Installing Git][pg-install] of the book _[Pro Git][pg]_ by Chacon and Straub.
_Pro Git_ is an excellent reference for all things Git, so much so that a
digital version is available for free on the Git website.
