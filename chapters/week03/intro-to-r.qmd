# Introduction to R

:::{.callout-note title="Learning Goals" collapse="false"}
After this lesson, you should be able to:

* Run code in the R console
* Call functions and create variables
* Check (in)equality of values
* Describe a file system, directory, and working directory
* Write paths to files or directories
* Get or set the R working directory
* Identify RDS, CSV, TSV files and functions for reading these
* Inspect the structure of a data frame
:::

## Why R?

:::{.callout-note title="Why should you use a programming language?"}
Code you write is **reproducible**: you can share it with someone else, and if
they run it with the same inputs, they'll get the same results. By writing
code, you create an unambiguous record of every step taken in your analysis.
This is one of the major advantages of programming languages over
point-and-click software like *Tableau* or *Microsoft Excel*.

Another advantage of writing code is that it's often **reusable**. This means
you can:

* Automate repetitive tasks within an analysis
* Recycle code from one analysis into another
* Package useful code for distribution to your colleagues or the general
  public

**[R][]** is a programming language for statistical computing and graphics. It
provides a rich set of built-in tools for cleaning, exploring, modeling, and
visualizing data.

[R]: https://www.r-project.org/

:::{.callout-note}
The term "R" can mean the R language (the code) or the R interpreter (the
software which runs the code). Most of the time, the meaning is clear from the
context, but we'll be explicit in cases where the distinction is important.
:::

Compared to other programming languages, some of R's particular strengths are
its:

* Interactive interpreter and debugger
* Focus on statistical computing
    - Many statistical estimators, tests, and models are built-in
    - Statisticians tend to implement new methods in R first
* Over 23,000 community-developed **packages**: reusable bundles of code, often
  accompanied by documentation, examples, or data sets
* Functions and packages for creating high-quality data visualizations
* Flexible support for many different programming abstractions and paradigms

The main way you'll interact with R is by writing R code or **expressions**.
We'll explain more soon, but first we need to install R and associated
software.

:::{.callout-important}
To follow along with this and subsequent chapters, you'll need a recent
version of R.

[Click here][r-dl] to download the R installer. When the download is complete,
run the installer to install (or update) R on your computer. We recommend
keeping the installer's default settings.

[r-dl]: https://cloud.r-project.org/

In addition to R, you'll need a recent version of RStudio. RStudio is an
**integrated development environment** (IDE), which means it's a comprehensive
program for writing, editing, searching, and running code. You can do all of
these things without RStudio, but RStudio makes the process easier.

[Click here][rstudio-dl] to download the free RStudio Desktop installer. When
the download is complete, run the installer to install RStudio Deskop on your
computer.

## The RStudio Interface

The first time you open RStudio, you'll see a window divided into several
panes, like this:

![
  How RStudio typically looks the first time you open it. Don't worry if the
  text in the panes isn't exactly the same on your computer: it depends on your
  operating system and versions of R and RStudio.
](/images/week03/rstudio_start.png){.lightbox}

The console pane, on the left, is the main interface to R. If you type R code
into the console and press the `Enter` key on your keyboard, R will run your
code and return the result.

On the right are the environment pane and the plots pane. The environment pane
shows data in your R workspace. The plots pane shows any plots you make, and
also has tabs to browse your file system and to view R's built-in help files.
You'll learn more about these gradually, but for now, focus on the console
pane.

Let's start by using R to do some arithmetic. In the console, you'll see that
the cursor is on a line that begins with `>`, called the **prompt**. You can
make R compute the sum $2 + 2$ by typing the code `2 + 2` after the prompt and
then pressing the `Enter` key. Your code and the result from R should look like
this:

![](/images/week03/arithmetic.png)

R always puts the result on a separate line (or lines) from your code. In this
case, the result begins with the tag `[1]`, which is a hint from R that the
result is a **vector** and that this line starts with the **element** at
position 1. You'll learn more about vectors in @sec-vectors, and eventually
learn about other data types that are displayed differently. The result of the
sum, `4`, is displayed after the tag.

If you enter an incomplete expression, R will change the prompt to `+`, then
wait for you to type the rest of the expression and press the `Enter` key.
Here's what it looks like if you only enter `2 +`:

![](/images/week03/incomplete.png)

You can finish entering the expression, or you can cancel it by pressing the
`Esc` key (or `Ctrl`-`c` if you're using R without RStudio). R can only tell an
expression is incomplete if it's missing something, like the second operand in
`2 +`. So if you mean to enter `2 + 2` but accidentally enter `2`, which is a
complete expression by itself, don't expect R to read your mind and wait for
more input!


## R Basics

Try out some other arithmetic in the R console. Besides `+` for addition, the
other arithmetic operators are:

* `-` for subtraction
* `*` for multiplication
* `/` for division
* `%%` for remainder division (modulo)
* `^` or `**` for exponentiation

You can combine these and use parentheses to make more complicated expressions,
just as you would when writing a mathematical expression. When R computes a
result, it follows the standard order of operations: parentheses,
exponentiation, multiplication, division, addition, and finally subtraction.
For example, to estimate the area of a circle with radius 3, you can write:

```{r}
3.14 * 3^2
```

You can write R expressions with any number of spaces (including none) around
the operators and R will still compute the result.

:::{.callout-tip}
Use spaces!

As with writing text, putting spaces in your code makes it easier for you and
others to read, so it's good to make it a habit. Put a single space on each
side of most operators, after commas, and after keywords.
:::


### Variables

Since R is designed for mathematics and statistics, you might expect that it
provides a better appoximation for $\pi$ than `3.14`. R and most other
programming languages allow you to create named values, or **variables**. R
provides a built-in variable called `pi` for the value of $\pi$. You can
display a variable's value by entering its name in the console:

```{r}
pi
```

You can also use variables in expressions. For instance, here's a more precise
expression for the area of a circle with radius 3:

```{r}
pi * 3^2
```

You can create a variable with the assignment operator `=` by writing a name on
the left-hand side and a value or expression on the right-hand side. For
example, to save the area of the circle in a variable called `area`, you can
write:


```{r}
area = pi * 3^2
```

:::{.callout-note}
You can use the arrow operator `<-` instead of the assignment operator:

```{r}
area <- pi * 3^2
```

In most cases, the two operators are interchangeable. For clarity, it's best to
choose one you like and use it consistently in all of your R code. In this
reader, we use `=` because it's the assignment operator in most programming
languages and it's easier to type.
:::

In R, variable names can contain any combination of letters and dots (`.`).
Names can also include numbers and underscores (`_`), but can't start with a
them. Spaces and other symbols are not allowed in variable names. So `geese`,
`top50.dogs`, and `nine_lives` are valid variable names, but `goose teeth`,
`_fishes`, and `9lives` are not.

The main reason to use variables is to temporarily save results from
expressions so that you can use them in other expressions. For instance, now
you can use the `area` variable anywhere you want the area of the circle.

Notice that when you assign a result to a variable, R doesn't automatically
display that result. If you want to see the result as well, you have to enter
the variable's name as a separate expression:

```{r}
area
```

Another reason to use variables is to make an expression clearer and more
general. For instance, you might want to compute the area of several circles
with different radii. Then the expression `pi * 3^2` is too specific. Instead,
you can create a variable `r`, then rewrite the expression as `pi * r^2`. This
makes the expression easier to understand, because the reader doesn't have to
intuit that `3` is the radius in the formula. Here's the code to compute and
display the area of a circle with radius 1 this way:

```{r}
r = 1
area = pi * r^2
area
```

Now if you want to compute the area for a different radius, all you have to do
is change `r` and run the code again (R will not change `area` until you do
this). Writing code that's general enough to reuse across multiple problems can
be a big time-saver in the long run. Later on, you'll learn ways to make this
code even easier to reuse.

:::{.callout-tip}
Try to choose descriptive variable names, so that you and your collaborators
can understand the meaning and purpose of each variable when reading the code.
:::


### Strings

R treats anything inside single or double quotes as literal text rather than as
an expression to evaluate. In programming jargon, a piece of literal text is
called a **string**. You can use whichever kind of quotes you prefer, but the
quote at the beginning of the string must match the quote at the end.

```{r}
'Hi'
"Hello!"
```

Numbers and strings are not the same thing, so for example R considers `1`
different from `"1"`. As a result, you can't use strings with most of R's
arithmetic operators. For instance, this code causes an error:

```{r, error = TRUE}
"1" + 3
```

The error message notes that `+` is not defined for non-numeric values.


### Comparisons {#sec-comparisons}

Besides arithmetic, you can also use R to compare values. Programming tasks
often involve comparing values. Use **comparison operators** to do so:

* `<` for "less than"
* `>` for "greater than"
* `<=` for "less than or equal to"
* `>=` for "greater than or equal to"
* `==` for "equal to"
* `!=` for "not equal to"

Notice that the "equal to" operator is two equal signs. This is to distinguish
it from the assignment operator `=`.

Let's look at a few examples:
```{r}
1.5 < 3
"a" > "b"
pi == 3.14
"hi" == 'hi'
```

When you make a comparison, R returns a **logical** value, `TRUE` or `FALSE`,
to indicate the result. Logical values are not the same as strings, so they are
not quoted.

Logical values are values, so you can use them in other computations. For
example:

```{r}
TRUE
TRUE == FALSE
```

@sec-logic describes more ways to use and combine logical values.

:::{.callout-warning}
Some of R's equality operators return `TRUE` even when comparing two different
types of data:

```{r}
"1" == 1
"TRUE" <= TRUE
"FALSE" <= TRUE
```

@sec-implicit-coercion explains why this happens, and
@sec-more-about-comparisons explains several other ways to compare values.
:::


### Calling Functions {#sec-calling-functions}

R can do a lot more than just arithmetic. Most of R's features are provided
through **functions**, pieces of reusable code. You can think of a function as
a machine that takes some inputs and uses them to produce some output. In
programming jargon, the inputs to a function are called **arguments**, the
output is called the **return value**, and when you use a function, you're
**calling** the function.

To call a function, write its name followed by parentheses. Put any arguments
to the function inside the parentheses. For example, the function to round a
number to a specified decimal place is named `round`. So you can round the
number `8.153` to the nearest integer with this code:

```{r}
round(8.153)
```

Many functions accept more than one argument. For instance, the `round`
function accepts at least two arguments: the number to round and the number of
decimal places to keep. When you call a function with multiple arguments,
separate the arguments with commas. So to round `8.153` to 1 decimal place:

```{r}
round(8.153, 1)
```

When you call a function, R assigns the arguments to the function's
**parameter**. Parameters are special variables that represent the inputs to a
function and only exist while that function runs. For example, the `round`
function has parameters `x` and `digits`. The next section, @sec-getting-help,
explains how to look up the parameters of a function.

Some parameters have **default arguments**. A parameter is automatically
assigned its default argument whenever the parameter's argument is not
specified explicitly. As a result, assigning arguments to these parameters is
optional. For instance, the `digits` parameter of `round` has a default
argument (round to the nearest integer), so it's okay to call `round` without
setting `digits`, as in `round(8.153)`. In contrast, the `x` parameter doesn't
have a default argument. @sec-getting-help explains how to look up the default
arguments for a function.

By default, R assigns arguments to parameters based on their position. The
first argument is assigned to the function's first parameter, the second to the
second, and so on. So in the code above, `8.153` is assigned to `x` and `1` is
assigned to `digits`.

You can also assign arguments to parameters by name with `=` (not `<-`),
overriding their positions. So some other ways you could write the call above
are:

```{r}
round(8.153, digits = 1)
round(x = 8.153, digits = 1)
round(digits = 1, x = 8.153)
```

All of these are equivalent. When you write code, choose whatever seems the
clearest to you. Leaving parameter names out of calls saves typing, but
including some or all of them can make the code easier to understand.

Parameters are not regular variables, and only exist while their associated
function runs. You can't set them before a call, nor can you access them after
a call. So this code causes an error:

```{r, error = TRUE}
x = 4.755
round(digits = 2)
```

In the error message, R says that you forgot to assign an argument to the
parameter `x`. You can keep the variable `x` and correct the call by making `x`
an argument (for the parameter `x`):

```{r}
round(x, digits = 2)
```

Or, written more explicitly:

```{r}
round(x = x, digits = 2)
```

The point is that variables and parameters are distinct, even if they happen to
have the same name. The variable `x` is not the same thing as the parameter
`x`.


### Comments

In R and most other programming languages, you can mark parts of your code as
**comments**: expressions to ignore rather than run. Use comments to plan,
explain, and document your code. You can also temporarily "comment out" code to
prevent it from running, which is often helpful for testing and debugging.

R comments begin with number sign `#` and extend to the end of the line:

```{r}
# This is a comment.
```

R will ignore comments when you run your code.


## Getting Help {#sec-getting-help}

Learning and using a language is hard, so it's important to know how to get
help. The first place to look for help is R's built-in documentation. In the
console, you can access a specific help page by name with `?` followed by the
name of the page.

There are help pages for all of R's built-in functions, usually with the same
name as the function itself. So the code to open the help page for the `round`
function is:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
?round
```

For functions, help pages usually include a brief description, a list of
parameters, a description of the return value, and some examples. The help page
for `round` shows that there are two parameters `x` and `digits`. It also says
that `digits = 0`, meaning the default argument for `digits` is `0`.

There are also help pages for other topics, such as built-in mathematical
constants (such as `?pi`), data sets (such as `?iris`), and operators. To look
up the help page for an operator, put the operator's name in single or double
quotes. For example, this code opens the help page for the arithmetic
operators:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
?"+"
```

It's always okay to put quotes around the name of the page when you use `?`,
but they're only required if it contains non-alphabetic characters. So `?sqrt`,
`?'sqrt'`, and `?"sqrt"` all open the documentation for `sqrt`, the square root
function.

Sometimes you might not know the name of the help page you want to look up. You
can do a general search of R's help pages with `??` followed by a string of
search terms. For example, to get a list of all help pages related to linear
models:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
??"linear model"
```

This search function doesn't always work well, and it's often more efficient to
use an online search engine. When you search for help with R online, include
"R" as a search term. Alternatively, you can use [RSeek][rseek], which
restricts the search to a selection of R-related websites.

[rseek]: https://rseek.org/


### When Something Goes Wrong

As a programmer, sooner or later you'll run some code and get an error message
or result you didn't expect. Don't panic! Even experienced programmers make
mistakes regularly, so learning how to diagnose and fix problems is vital.

Try going through these steps:

1. If R returned a warning or error message, read it! If you're not sure what
   the message means, try searching for it online.
2. Check your code for typographical errors, including incorrect capitalization
   and missing or extra commas, quotes, and parentheses.
3. Test your code one line at a time, starting from the beginning. After each
   line that assigns a variable, check that the value of the variable is what
   you expect. Try to determine the exact line where the problem originates
   (which may differ from the line that emits an error!).

If none of these steps help, try asking online. [Stack Overflow][stacko] is a
popular question and answer website for programmers. Before posting, make sure
to read about [how to ask a good question][goodq].

## The Working Directory Revisited

<!-- FIXME -->
This section is a review of how files on a computer work. You’ll need to
understand this in order to read a data set from a file, and it’s also
important for finding your saved notebooks and modules later.

@sec-absolute-relative-paths explained that relative paths have a starting
point that depends on the context where the path is used. The **working
directory** is the starting point R uses for relative paths. Think of the
working directory as the directory R is currently "at" or watching.

The function `getwd` returns the absolute path for the current working
directory, as a string. It doesn't require any arguments:

```{r}
getwd()
```

On your computer, the output from `getwd` will likely be different. This is a
very useful function for getting your bearings when you write relative paths.
If you write a relative path and it doesn't work as expected, the first thing
to do is check the working directory.

The related `setwd` function changes the working directory. It takes one
argument: a path to the new working directory. Here's an example:

```{r eval=FALSE}
setwd("..")

# Now check the working directory.
getwd()
```

:::{.callout-warning}
In your R scripts and notebooks, avoid calls to `setwd`. They make your code
more difficult to understand and to run on other computers. Use appropriate
relative paths instead.

In the R console, it's okay to occasionally use `setwd`. You might need to
change the working directory before you run some code. R's default working
directory is your home directory. In some cases, such as when you open a
project, RStudio will automatically change the working directory. However, it
doesn't always change the working directory, so `setwd` is sometimes still
necessary.
:::

Another function that's useful for dealing with the working directory and file
system is `list.files`. The `list.files` function returns the names of all of
the files and directories inside of a directory. It accepts a path to a
directory as an argument, or assumes the working directory if you don't pass a
path. For instance:

```{r}
# List files and directories in /home/.
list.files("/home/")

# List files and directories in the working directory.
list.files()
```

As usual, since you have a different computer, you're likely to see different
output if you run this code. If you call `list.files` with an invalid path or
an empty directory, the output is `character(0)`:

```{r}
list.files("/this/path/is/fake/")
```

Later on, you'll learn about what `character(0)` means more generally.


## Saving & Loading Code

:::{.callout-tip}
When you start a new project, it's a good idea to create a specific directory
for all of the project's files. If you're using R, you should also store your R
code in that directory. As you work, periodically save your code.
:::

Most of the time, you won't just write code directly into the R console.
Reproducibility and reusability are important benefits of R over
point-and-click software, and in order to realize these, you have to save your
code to your computer's hard drive.

The most common way to save R code is as an R **script** with the extension
`.R` (see @sec-reading-files for more about extensions). Editing a script is
similar to editing any other text file. You can write, delete, copy, cut, and
paste code.

In RStudio, you can create a new R script with this menu option:

```
File -> New File -> R Script
```

This will open a new pane in RStudio, like this:

![
  How RStudio typically looks after opening a new R Script.
](/images/week03/rstudio_script.png)

The new pane is the scripts pane, which displays all of the R scripts you're
editing. Each script appears in a separate tab. In the screenshot, only one
script, the new script, is open.

Every line in an R script must be valid R code. Anything else you want to write
in the script (notes, documentation, etc.) must be placed in a comment.

Arrange your code in the order of the steps to solve the problem, even if you
write some parts before others. Comment out or delete any lines of code that
you try but ultimately decide you don't need. Make sure to save the file
periodically so that you don't lose your work. Following these guidelines will
help you stay organized and make it easier to share your code with others
later.

:::{.callout-tip}
While editing, you can run the current line in the R console by pressing
`Ctrl`-`Enter` on Windows and Linux, or `Cmd`-`Enter` on macOS. This way you
can test and correct your code as you write it.
:::


### Running Scripts

You can **source** (that is, run) an entire R script by calling the `source`
function with the path to the script as an argument. This is also what the
"Source on Save" check box refers to in RStudio. The code runs in order, only
stopping if an error occurs.

For instance, if you save the script as `my_cool_script.R`, then you can enter
`source("my_cool_script.R")` in the console to run the entire script. Pay
attention to the path---it may be different on your computer.


### Notebooks: Quarto & R Markdown

In the context of data science, a **notebook** is an interactive file that can
store a mix of code, formatted text, and images. With a notebook, you can
write, run code, and view results all in one place. Viewing and editing a
notebook requires a web browser or IDE. Some notebooks can also be converted to
static documents, such as PDFs. Comments are a good way keep notes as you
develop and run your code, but notebooks provide much more flexibility of
expression. Notebooks are a kind of [literate programming][lit].

[lit]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming

Notebooks excel when you want to do highly interactive work and/or want to
communicate results. Use notebooks to prototype code, analyze data, refine
plots, generate documents and presentations, and practice programming. Scripts
excel when you want to reuse code (and perhaps share it as a package) or want
to run code that doesn't require much user interaction (such as time-consuming
computations you'll run on a server or high-performance computing cluster). The
remainder of this reader assumes you're using an R script rather than the R
console or a notebook, unless otherwise noted.

[Quarto][] is a popular notebook format and system for R. It also supports
Python, Julia, and other programming languages. Quarto files have the extension
`.qmd`. Quarto is based on an older notebook format, [R Markdown][rmd], which
only supports R and can't be converted to as many kinds of documents. R
Markdown is still widely used. R Markdown files have the extension `.Rmd`.

[Quarto]: https://quarto.org/
[rmd]: https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/

:::{.callout-important}
In order to use [Quarto][], you must first download and install it. It is not
included with R or RStudio.
:::

After installing Quarto, you can create a new Quarto file in RStudio with this
menu option:

```
File -> New -> Quarto Document...
```

RStudio will prompt you to provide some details about the purpose of the file.

Notebooks are subdivided into **chunks** (or cells). You can create as many
chunks as you like, but each chunk can contain only one kind of content. You
can run a code chunk by clicking on the chunk and pressing `Ctrl`-`Enter`. The
notebook will display the result.

Markdown is a simple language you can use to add formatting to (non-code) text
in a notebook. For example, surrounding a word with asterisks, as in `Let
*sleeping* dogs lie`, makes the surrounded word italic. You can find a short,
interactive tutorial about Markdown [here][mdtutorial].

<!--
Now that you know how file systems and paths work, you're ready to learn how to
save your R code to a file. R code is usually saved into an **R script**
(extension `.R`) or an **R Markdown file** (extension `.Rmd`). R scripts are
slightly simpler, so let's focus on those.

Editing a script is similar to editing any other text document. You can write,
delete, copy, cut, and paste text. You can also save the file to your
computer's file system. When you do, pay attention to where you save the file,
as you might need it later.
-->


## Reading Files {#sec-reading-files}

Analyzing data sets is one of the most common things to do in R. The first step
is to get R to read your data. Data sets come in a variety of file formats, and
you need to identify the format in order to tell R how to read the data.

Most of the time, you can guess the format of a file by looking at its
**extension**, the characters (usually three) after the last dot `.` in the
filename. For example, the extension `.jpg` or `.jpeg` indicates a [JPEG image
file][jpg]. Some operating systems hide extensions by default, but you can find
instructions to change this setting online by searching for "show file
extensions" and your operating system's name. The extension is just part of the
file's name, so it should be taken as a hint about the file's format rather
than a guarantee.

[jpg]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG

R has built-in functions for reading a variety of formats. The R community also
provides **packages**, shareable and reusable pieces of code, to read even more
formats. You'll learn more about packages later, in @sec-packages. For now,
let's focus on data sets that can be read with R's built-in functions.

Here are several formats that are frequently used to distribute data, along
with the name of a built-in function or contributed package that can read the
format:

| Name                        | Extension  | Function or Package | Tabular?  | Text?
| :-------------------------- | :--------  | :------------------ | :-------- | :----
| Comma-separated Values      | `.csv`     | `read.csv`          | Yes       | Yes
| Tab-separated Values        | `.tsv`     | `read.delim`        | Yes       | Yes
| Fixed-width File            | `.fwf`     | `read.fwf`          | Yes       | Yes
| Microsoft Excel             | `.xlsx`    | readr package       | Yes       | No
| Microsoft Excel 1993-2007   | `.xls`     | readr package       | Yes       | No

A **tabular** data set is one that's structured as a table, with rows and
columns. This reader focuses on tabular data sets, since they're common in
practice and present the fewest programming challenges. Here's an example of a
tabular data set:

| Fruit  | Quantity | Price
| :----  | -------: | ----:
| apple  | 32       | 1.49
| banana | 541      | 0.79
| pear   | 10       | 1.99

A **text file** is a file that contains human-readable lines of text. You can
check this by opening the file with a text editor such as Microsoft Notepad or
macOS TextEdit. Many file formats use text in order to make the format easier
to work with.

For instance, a **comma-separated values** (CSV) file records a tabular data
using one line per row, with commas separating columns. If you store the table
above in a CSV file and open the file in a text editor, here's what you'll see:

```
Fruit,Quantity,Price
apple,32,1.49
banana,541,0.79
pear,10,1.99
```

A **binary file** is one that's not human-readable. You can't just read off the
data if you open a binary file in a text editor, but they have a number of
other advantages. Compared to text files, binary files are often faster to read
and take up less storage space (bytes).

As an example, R's built-in binary format is called RDS (which may stand for "R
data serialized"). RDS files are extremely useful for backing up work, since
they can store any kind of R object, even ones that are not tabular. You can
learn more about how to create an RDS file on the `?saveRDS` help page, and how
to read one on the `?readRDS` help page.


## Dataset: CA Least Terns {#sec-ca-least-terns}

The California least tern is a endangered subspecies of seabird that nests
along the coast of California and Mexico. The California Department of Fish and
Wildlife (CDFW) monitors least tern nesting sites across the state to estimate
breeding pairs, fledglings, and predator activity in each annual breeding
season.

:::

Let's use R to read the California least tern data set. The data set is in a
file called is `2000-2023_ca_least_tern.csv`, which suggests it's a CSV file.
The function to read a CSV file is `read.csv`. The function's first and only
required argument is the path to the CSV file.

In the following code, the path to the California least tern data set is
`data/2000-2023_ca_least_tern.csv`, but it might be different for you,
depending on R's working directory and where you saved the file. We'll save the
result from the `read.csv` function in a variable called `terns`. We can use
this variable to access the data in subsequent code.

```{r}
terns = read.csv("data/2000-2023_ca_least_tern.csv")
```

:::{.callout-note}
The variable name `terns` is arbitrary; you can choose something different if
you want. However, in general, it's a good habit to choose variable names that
describe the contents of the variable somehow.
:::

If you tried running the line of code above and got an error message, pay
attention to what the error message says, and remember the strategies to get
help from @sec-getting-help. The most common mistake when reading a file is
incorrectly specifying the path, so first check that you got the path right.

If the code ran without errors, it's a good idea to check that the data set
looks like what the documentation describes. When working with a new data set,
it usually isn't a good idea to print the whole thing (at least until you know
how big it is). Large data sets can take a long time to print, and the output
can be difficult to read.

Instead, use the `head` function to print only the beginning, or head, of the
data set:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
head(terns)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(terns))
```

If you run this code and see a similar table, then congratulations, you've read
your first data set into R! ✨

The California least terns data set is tabular---as you might have already
guessed, since it came from a CSV file. In R, it's represented by a **data
frame**, a table with rows and columns. R uses data frames to represent most
(but not all) kinds of tabular data. The `read.csv` function, which you used to
read this data, always returns a data frame.

Typically, each row in a data frame corresponds to a single subject and
is called an **observation**. Each column corresponds to a measurement of the
subject and is called a **feature** or **covariate**.

:::{.callout-note}
Sometimes people also refer to columns as “variables," but we'll try to avoid
this, because in programming contexts a variable is a name for a value (which
might not be a column).
:::

When you first read an object into R, you might not know whether it's a data
frame. One way to check is visually, by printing it (as you just did with
`head`). A better way to check is with the `class` function, which returns
information about what an object is. For a data frame, the result will always
contain `data.frame`:

```{r}
class(terns)
```

You'll learn more about classes in @sec-data-types-classes, but for now you can
use this function to identify data frames.


## Inspecting a Data Frame {#sec-data-frames}

Similar to how the `head` function shows the first six rows of a data frame,
the `tail` function shows the last six:

```{r}
tail(terns)
```

If there are lots of columns or the columns are wide, as is the case here, R
wraps the output across lines.

:::{.callout-tip}
Both `head` and `tail` accept an optional second argument that specifies the
number of rows to print:

```{r}
head(terns, 1)
```
:::

One way to get a quick idea of what your data looks like without having to skim
through all the columns and rows is by inspecting its **dimensions**. This is
the number of rows and columns in a data frame, and you can access this
information with the `dim` function:

```{r}
dim(terns)
```

So this data set has `r nrow(terns)` rows and `r ncol(terns)` columns. As an
alternative to the `dim` function, you can use the `nrow` and `ncol` functions
to get just the number of rows and number of columns, respectively.

Since the columns have names, you might also want to get just these. You can do
that with the `names` or `colnames` functions. Both return the same result:

```{r}
names(terns)
colnames(terns)
```

If the rows have names, you can get those with the `rownames` function. For
this particular data set, the rows don't have names.


### Summarizing Data

An efficient way to get a sense of what's actually in a data set is to have R
compute summary information. This works especially well for data frames, but
also applies to other data. R provides two different functions to get
summaries: `str` and `summary`.

The `str` function returns a **structural summary** of an object. This kind of
summary tells us about the structure of the data---the number of rows, the
number and names of columns, what kind of data is in each column, and some
sample values. Here's the structural summary for the least terns data set:

```{r}
str(terns)
```

This summary lists information about each column, and includes most of what you
found earlier by using several different functions separately. The summary uses
`chr` to indicate columns of text ("characters") and `int` to indicate columns
of integers.

In contrast to `str`, the `summary` function returns a **statistical summary**
of an object. This summary includes summary statistics for each column,
choosing appropriate statistics based on the kind of data in the column. For
numbers, this is generally the mean, median, and quantiles. For categories,
this is the frequencies. Other kinds of statistics are shown for other kinds of
data. Here's the statistical summary for the least terns data set:

```{r}
summary(terns)
```


### Selecting Columns

You can select an individual column from a data frame by name with `$`, the
dollar sign operator. The syntax is:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
VARIABLE$COLUMN_NAME
```

For example, for the least terns data set, `terns$year` selects the `year`
column, which is the year of observation:

```{r}
terns$year
```

R provides a variety of functions to compute on columns (and other vectors of
data). For instance, what if you want to know the time period the data set
covers? You can use the `range` function to compute the minimum and maximum of
a column:

```{r}
range(terns$year)
```

So the oldest observations are from `r min(terns$year)` and the newest are from
`r max(terns$year)`, although this function and output doesn't tell us whether
there are observations for the years in between.

You can count the observations for each year with the `table` function:

```{r}
table(terns$year)
```

The `table` function is great for summarizing columns of categories, where
numerical statistics like means and standard deviations aren't defined.

On the other hand, numerical statistics work well for summarizing columns of
numbers. You can use the `mean` function to compute the mean of a column. For
instance, let's compute the mean of the `total_nests` column, which is the
total number of nests seen at a site:

```{r}
mean(terns$total_nests)
```

The result is `NA` because column is missing some values (we'll explain this in
detail in @sec-missing-values). To compute the mean with only the values that
are present, set `na.rm = TRUE` in the call to `mean`:

```{r}
mean(terns$total_nests, na.rm = TRUE)
```

You can also use the dollar sign operator to assign values to columns. For
instance, to assign `2000` to the entire `year` column:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
terns$year = 2000
```

Be careful when you do this, as there is no undo. Fortunately, you haven't
saved this change to the least terns data set to your computer's hard drive
yet, so you can reload the data set to reset it:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
terns = read.csv("data/2000-2023_ca_least_tern.csv")
```

In @sec-indexing, you'll learn how to select rows and individual elements from
a data frame, as well as other ways to select columns.
