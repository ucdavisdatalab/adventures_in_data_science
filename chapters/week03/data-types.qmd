The previous chapter introduced R and gave you enough background to do some
simple computations on data sets. This chapter focuses on the foundational
knowledge and skills you'll need in order to use R effectively in the long
term. Specifically, it begins with a deep dive into R's various data structures
and data types, then explains a variety of ways to get and set their elements.


## Vectors {#sec-vectors}

```{r, echo = FALSE}
terns = read.csv("data/2000-2023_ca_least_tern.csv")
```

A **vector** is a collection of values. Vectors are the fundamental unit of
data in R, and you've already used them in the previous sections.

For instance, each column in a data frame is a vector. So the `site_name`
column in the California least terns data set (@sec-ca-least-terns) is a
vector. Take a look at it now. You can use `head` to avoid printing too much.
Set the second argument to `10` so that exactly 10 values are printed:

```{r}
head(terns$site_name, 10)
```

Like all vectors, this vector is **ordered**, which just means the values, or
**elements**, have specific positions. The value of the 1st element is
`r terns$site_name[[1]]`, the 2nd is `r terns$site_name[[2]]`, the 5th is
`r terns$site_name[[5]]`, and so on.

Notice that the elements of this vector are all strings. In R, the elements of
a vector must all be the same type of data (we say the elements are
**homogeneous**). A vector can contain integers, decimal numbers, strings, or
any of several other types of data, but not a mix these all at once.

The other columns in the least terns data frame are also vectors. For instance,
the `year` column is a vector of integers:

```{r}
head(terns$year)
```

Vectors can contain any number of elements, including 0 or 1 element. Unlike
mathematics, R does not distinguish between vectors and scalars (solitary
values). As far as R is concerned, a solitary value, like `3`, is a vector with
1 element.

You can check the length of a vector (and other objects) with the `length`
function:

```{r}
length(3)
length("hello")
length(terns$year)
```

Since the last of these is a column from the data frame `terns`, the length is
the same as the number of rows in `terns`.


### Creating Vectors

Sometimes you'll want to create your own vectors. You can do this by
concatenating several vectors together with the `c` function. It accepts any
number of vector arguments, and combines them into a single vector:

```{r}
c(1, 2, 19, -3)
c("hi", "hello")
c(1, 2, c(3, 4))
```

If the arguments you pass to the `c` function have different data types, R will
attempt to convert them to a common data type that preserves the information:

```{r}
c(1, "cool", 2.3)
```

@sec-implicit-coercion explains the rules for this conversion in more detail.

The colon operator `:` creates vectors that contain sequences of integers. This
is useful for creating "toy" data to test things on, and later we'll see that
it's also important in several other contexts. Here are a few different
sequences:

```{r}
1:3
-3:5
10:1
```

Beware that both endpoints are included in the sequence, even in sequences like
`1:0`, and that the difference between elements is always `-1` or `1`. If you
want more control over the generated sequence, use the `seq` function instead.


### Indexing Vectors {#sec-indexing-vectors}

You can access individual elements of a vector with the **indexing operator**
`[` (also called the square bracket operator). The syntax is:

```
VECTOR[INDEXES]
```

Here `INDEXES` is a vector of positions of elements you want to get or set.

For example, let's make a vector with 5 elements and get the 2nd element:

```{r}
x = c(4, 8, 3, 2, 1)
x[2]
```

Now let's get the 3rd and 1st element:

```{r}
x[c(3, 1)]
```

You can use the indexing operator together with the assignment operator to
assign elements of a vector:

```{r}
x[3] = 0
x
```

Indexing is among the most frequently used operations in R, so take some time
to try it out with few different vectors and indexes. We'll revisit indexing in
@sec-indexing to learn a lot more about it.


### Vectorization {#sec-vectorization}

Let's look at what happens if we call a mathematical function, like `sin`, on a
vector:

```{r}
x = c(1, 3, 0, pi)
sin(x)
```

This gives us the same result as if we had called the function separately on
each element. That is, the result is the same as:

```{r}
c(sin(1), sin(3), sin(0), sin(pi))
```

Of course, the first version is much easier to type.

Functions that take a vector argument and get applied element-by-element like
this are said to be **vectorized**. Most functions in R are vectorized,
especially math functions. Some examples include `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, `log`,
`exp`, and `sqrt`.

Functions that are not vectorized tend to be ones that combine or aggregate
values in some way. For instance, the `sum`, `mean`, `median`, `length`, and
`class` functions are not vectorized.

A function can be vectorized across multiple arguments. This is easiest to
understand in terms of the arithmetic operators. Let's see what happens if we
add two vectors together:

```{r}
x = c(1, 2, 3, 4)
y = c(-1, 7, 10, -10)
x + y
```

The elements are paired up and added according to their positions. The other
arithmetic operators are also vectorized:

```{r}
x - y
x * y
x / y
```

### Recycling {#sec-recycling}

When a function is vectorized across multiple arguments, what happens if the
vectors have different lengths? Whenever you think of a question like this as
you're learning R, the best way to find out is to create some toy data and test
it yourself. Let's try that now:

```{r}
x = c(1, 2, 3, 4)
y = c(-1, 1)
x + y
```

The elements of the shorter vector are **recycled** to match the length of the
longer vector. That is, after the second element, the elements of `y` are
repeated to make a vector with the same length as `x` (because `x` is longer),
and then vectorized addition is carried out as usual.

Here's what that looks like written down:

```
   1  2  3  4
+ -1  1 -1  1
  -----------
   0  3  2  5
```

If the length of the longer vector is not a multiple of the length of the
shorter vector, R issues a warning, but still returns the result. The warning
as meant as a reminder, because unintended recycling is a common source of
bugs:

```{r}
x = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
y = c(-1, 1)
x + y
```

Recycling might seem strange at first, but it's convenient if you want to use a
specific value (or pattern of values) with a vector. For instance, suppose you
want to multiply all the elements of a vector by `2`. Recycling makes this
easy:

```{r}
2 * c(1, 2, 3)
```

When you use recycling, most of the time one of the arguments will be a scalar
like this.


## Data Types & Classes {#sec-data-types-classes}

Data can be categorized into different **types** based on sets of shared
characteristics. For instance, statisticians tend to think about whether data
are numeric or categorical:

* numeric
    + continuous (real or complex numbers)
    + discrete (integers)
* categorical
    + nominal (categories with no ordering)
    + ordinal (categories with some ordering)

Of course, other types of data, like graphs (networks) and natural language
(books, speech, and so on), are also possible. Categorizing data this way is
useful for reasoning about which methods to apply to which data.

In R, data objects are categorized in two different ways:

1. The **class** of an R object describes what the object does, or the role
   that it plays. Sometimes objects can do more than one thing, so objects can
   have more than one class. The `class` function, which debuted
   in @sec-data-frames, returns the classes of its argument.

2. The **type** of an R object describes what the object is. Technically, the
   type corresponds to how the object is stored in your computer's memory. Each
   object has exactly one type. The `typeof` function returns the type of its
   argument.

Of the two, classes tend to be more important than types. If you aren't sure
what an object is, checking its classes should be the first thing you do.

The built-in classes you'll use all the time correspond to vectors and lists
(which we'll learn more about in @sec-lists):

| Class     | Example               | Description
| :----     | :------               | :----------
| logical   | `TRUE`, `FALSE`       | Logical (or Boolean) values
| integer   | `-1L`, `1L`, `2L`     | Integer numbers
| numeric   | `-2.1`, `7`, `34.2`   | Real numbers
| complex   | `3-2i`, `-8+0i`       | Complex numbers
| character | `"hi"`, `"YAY"`       | Text strings
| list      | `list(TRUE, 1, "hi")` | Ordered collection of heterogeneous elements

R doesn't distinguish between scalars and vectors, so the class of a vector is
the same as the class of its elements:

```{r}
class("hi")
class(c("hello", "hi"))
```

In addition, for most vectors, the class and the type are the same:

```{r}
x = c(TRUE, FALSE)
class(x)
typeof(x)
```

The exception to this rule is numeric vectors, which have type `double` for
historical reasons:

```{r}
class(pi)
typeof(pi)
typeof(3)
```

The word "double" here stands for [double-precision floating point
number][double], a standard way to represent real numbers on computers.

[double]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format

By default, R assumes any numbers you enter in code are numeric, even if
they're integer-valued.

The class `integer` also represents integer numbers, but it's not used as often
as `numeric`. A few functions, such as the sequence operator `:` and the
`length` function, return integers. You can also force R to create an integer
by adding the suffix `L` to a number, but there are no major drawbacks to using
the `double` default:

```{r}
class(1:3)
class(3)
class(3L)
```

Besides the classes for vectors and lists, there are several built-in classes
that represent more sophisticated data structures:

| Class      | Description
| :----      | :----------
| function   | Functions
| factor     | Categorical values
| matrix     | Two-dimensional ordered collection of homogeneous elements
| array      | Multi-dimensional ordered collection of homogeneous elements
| data.frame | Data frames

For these, the class is usually different from the type. We'll learn more about
most of these later on.


### Lists {#sec-lists}

A **list** is an ordered data structure where the elements can have different
types (they are **heterogeneous**). This differs from a vector, where the
elements all have to have the same type, as we saw in @sec-vectors. The
tradeoff is that most vectorized functions do not work with lists.

You can make an ordinary list with the `list` function:

```{r}
x = list(1, c("hi", "bye"))
class(x)
typeof(x)
```

For ordinary lists, the type and the class are both `list`. In @sec-indexing,
we'll learn how to get and set list elements, and in later sections we'll learn
more about when and why to use lists.

You've already seen one list, the `terns` data frame:

```{r}
class(terns)
typeof(terns)
```

Under the hood, data frames are lists, and each column is a list element.
Because the class is `data.frame` rather than `list`, R treats data frames
differently from ordinary lists. This difference is apparent in how data frames
are printed compared to ordinary lists.


### Implicit Coercion {#sec-implicit-coercion}

R's types fall into a natural hierarchy of expressiveness:

![R's hierarchy of types.](/images/types.png)

Each type on the right is more expressive than the ones to its left. That is,
with the convention that `FALSE` is `0` and `TRUE` is `1`, we can represent any
logical value as an integer. In turn, we can represent any integer as a double,
and any double as a complex number. By writing the number out, we can also
represent any complex number as a string.

The point is that no information is lost as we follow the arrows from left to
right along the types in the hierarchy. In fact, R will automatically and
silently convert from types on the left to types on the right as needed. This
is called **implicit coercion**.

As an example, consider what happens if we add a logical value to a number:

```{r}
TRUE + 2
```

R automatically converts the `TRUE` to the numeric value `1`, and then carries
out the arithmetic as usual.

We've already seen implicit coercion at work once before, when we learned the
`c` function. Since the elements of a vector all have to have the same type, if
you pass several different types to `c`, then R tries to use implicit coercion
to make them the same:

```{r}
x = c(TRUE, "hi", 1, 1+3i)
class(x)
x
```

Implicit coercion is strictly one-way; it never occurs in the other direction.
If you want to coerce a type on the right to one on the left, you can do it
explicitly with one of the `as.TYPE` functions. For instance, the `as.numeric`
(or `as.double`) function coerces to numeric:

```{r}
as.numeric("3.1")
```

There are a few types that fall outside of the hierarchy entirely, like
functions. Implicit coercion doesn't apply to these. If you try to use these
types where it doesn't make sense to, R generally returns an error:

```{r, error = TRUE}
sin + 3
```

If you try to use these types as elements of a vector, you get back a list
instead:

```{r}
x = c(1, 2, sum)
class(x)
```

Understanding how implicit coercion works will help you avoid bugs, and can
also be a time-saver. For example, we can use implicit coercion to succinctly
count how many elements of a vector satisfy a some condition:

```{r}
x = c(1, 3, -1, 10, -2, 3, 8, 2)
condition = x < 4
sum(condition)    # or sum(x < 4)
```

If you still don't quite understand how the code above works, try inspecting
each variable. In general, inspecting each step or variable is a good strategy
for understanding why a piece of code works (or doesn't work!). Here the
implicit coercion happens in the third line.


### Matrices & Arrays

A **matrix** is the two-dimensional analogue of a vector. The elements, which
are arranged into rows and columns, are ordered and homogeneous.

You can create a matrix from a vector with the `matrix` function. By default,
the columns are filled first:

```{r}
# A matrix with 2 rows and 3 columns:
matrix(1:6, 2, 3)
```

The class of a matrix is always `matrix`, and the type matches the type of the
elements:
```{r}
x = matrix(c("a", "b", NA, "c"), 2, 2)
x
class(x)
typeof(x)
```

You can use the matrix multiplication operator `%*%` to multiply two matrices
with compatible dimensions.

An **array** is a further generalization of matrices to higher dimensions. You
can create an array from a vector with the `array` function. The
characteristics of arrays are almost identical to matrices, but the class of an
array is always `array`.


### Factors

A feature is **categorical** if it measures a qualitative category. For
example, the genres `rock`, `blues`, `alternative`, `folk`, `pop` are
categories.

R uses the class `factor` to represent categorical data. Visualizations and
statistical models sometimes treat factors differently than other data types,
so it's important to make sure you have the right data type. If you're ever
unsure, remember that you can check the class of an object with the `class`
function.

When it reads a data set, R usually can't tell which features are categorical.
That means identifying and converting the categorical features is up to you.
For beginners, it can be difficult to understand whether a feature is
categorical or not. The key is to think about whether you want to use the
feature to divide the data into groups.

For example, if you want to know how many songs are in the `rock` genre, you
first need to divide the songs by genre, and then count the number of songs in
each group (or at least the `rock` group).

As a second example, months recorded as numbers can be categorical or not,
depending on how you want to use them. You might want to treat them as
categorical (for example, to compute max rainfall in each month) or you might
want to treat them as numbers (for example, to compute the number of months
time between two events).

The bottom line is that you have to think about what you'll be doing in the
analysis. In some cases, you might treat a feature as categorical only for part
of the analysis.

Let's think about which features are categorical in least terns data set. To
refresh your memory of what's in the data set, take a look at the structural
summary:

```{r}
str(terns)
```

The `site_name`, `site_abbr`, and `event` columns are all examples of
categorical data. The `region_` columns and some of the `pred_` columns also
contain categorical data.

One way to check whether a feature is useful for grouping (and thus effectively
categorical) is to count the number of times each value appears. You can do
this with the `table` function. For instance, to count the number of times each
category of `event` appears:

```{r}
table(terns$event)
```

Features with only a few unique values, repeated many times, are ideal for
grouping. Numerical features, like `total_nests`, usually aren't good for
grouping, both because of what they measure and because they tend to have many
unique values, which leads to very small groups.

The `year` column can be treated as categorical or quantitative data. It's easy
to imagine grouping observations by year, but years are also numerical: they
have an order and we might want to do math on them. The most appropriate type
for `year` depends on how we want to use it for analysis.

You can convert a column to the `factor` class with the `factor` function. Try
this for the `event` column:

```{r}
event = factor(terns$event)
event
```

Notice that factors are printed differently than strings.

The categories of a factor are called **levels**. You can list the levels with
the `levels` function:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
levels(event)
```

A factor remembers all possible levels even if you take a subset where some of
the levels aren't present:

```{r}
event[1:3]
levels(event[1:3])
```

This is an important way factors are different from strings (or `character`
vectors). It ensures that if you plot a factor, the missing levels will still
be represented on the plot.

:::{.callout-tip}
You can make a factor forget levels that aren't present with the `droplevels`
function:

```{r}
droplevels(event[1:3])
```
:::


## Special Values

R has four special values to represent missing or invalid data.

### Missing Values {#sec-missing-values}

The value `NA`, called the **missing value**, represents missing entries in a
data set. It's implied that the entries are missing due to how the data was
collected, although there are exceptions. As an example, imagine the data came
from a survey, and respondents chose not to answer some questions. In the data
set, their answers for those questions can be recorded as `NA`.

The missing value is a chameleon: it can be a logical, integer, numeric,
complex, or character value. By default, the missing value is logical, and the
other types occur through coercion (@sec-implicit-coercion):

```{r}
class(NA)

class(c(1, NA))

class(c("hi", NA, NA))
```

The missing value is also contagious: it represents an unknown quantity, so
using it as an argument to a function usually produces another missing value.
The idea is that if the inputs to a computation are unknown, generally so is
the output:

```{r}
NA - 3

mean(c(1, 2, NA))
```

As a consequence, testing whether an object is equal to the missing value with
`==` doesn't return a meaningful result:

```{r}
5 == NA

NA == NA
```

You can use the `is.na` function instead:

```{r}
is.na(5)

is.na(NA)

is.na(c(1, NA, 3))
```

Missing values are a feature that sets R apart from most other programming
languages.


### Infinity

The value `Inf` represents infinity, and can be numeric or complex. You're most
likely to encounter it as the result of certain computations:

```{r}
13 / 0

class(Inf)
```

You can use the `is.infinite` function to test whether a value is infinite:

```{r}
is.infinite(3)

is.infinite(c(-Inf, 0, Inf))
```

### Not a Number

The value `NaN` ("not a number") represents a quantity that's undefined
mathematically. For instance, dividing 0 by 0 is undefined:

```{r}
0 / 0

class(NaN)
```

Like `Inf`, `NaN` can be numeric or complex.

You can use the `is.nan` function to test whether a value is `NaN`:

```{r}
is.nan(c(10.1, log(-1), 3))
```


### Null

The value `NULL` represents a quantity that's undefined in R. Most of the time,
`NULL` indicates the absence of a result. For instance, vectors don't have
dimensions, so the `dim` function returns `NULL` for vectors:

```{r}
dim(c(1, 2))

class(NULL)

typeof(NULL)
```

Unlike the other special values, `NULL` has its own unique type and class.

You can use the `is.null` function to test whether a value is `NULL`:

```{r}
is.null("null")

is.null(NULL)
```
